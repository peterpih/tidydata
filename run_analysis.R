# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
#
# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average
#    of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
#
# This excercise is to make a smaller tidy-data data set from a larger one
# It involves having two parallel datasets (test and train) and merging them together
# The technique used here is to process each of the two data sets separately but in parallel
# and then merge them together
